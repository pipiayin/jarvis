A simple AI core has only two logic:
(1) firstly, understand its own environemnt
    (1.1) this by default use a few environment detection script
    (1.2) then it could gather via config files (or plug-ins)

(2) secondly, decide what should do now
    (2.1) a simple queue to hold 7 tasks
    (2.2) if no interrupt, execute tasks


It looks like some kind of OS, but should be 
(a) kept very simple (b) add machine learnning inside.


This logic inside this AI should be very simple, it depends on TASK to 
increase functions.
